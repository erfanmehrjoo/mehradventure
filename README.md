# VPN and Free Access to Information

This project explores the concept of Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) and their role in promoting free and secure access to information in the digital age. VPNs have become a crucial tool for privacy, security, and bypassing censorship in many regions. This project aims to examine how VPNs work, their applications, and the importance of free access to information for individuals around the world.

## Overview

As the internet has evolved, restrictions and censorship on access to information have become more prevalent. This project investigates VPN technology as a means to enhance internet freedom. VPNs encrypt users' internet traffic, masking their IP addresses, and allowing them to bypass geo-restrictions and censorship, ensuring access to a wider range of information. 

## Project Goals

- Explore how VPNs function and their significance in enhancing privacy and security online.
- Discuss the importance of unrestricted access to information for freedom of speech and democracy.
- Demonstrate practical use cases of VPNs in bypassing internet censorship.
- Examine the legal, ethical, and technical challenges associated with the use of VPNs.

## How VPN Works

A VPN creates a secure, encrypted tunnel between the user's device and the internet. This tunnel prevents third parties, such as ISPs and government agencies, from monitoring or intercepting the user's data. By masking the user's real IP address and routing their traffic through a remote server, a VPN allows users to access content that may be blocked or restricted in their region.

## Technologies Used

- **VPN Protocols**: OpenVPN, IKEv2/IPsec, WireGuard
- **Encryption**: AES-256, RSA-2048
- **Programming Languages**: Python, Bash (for automation scripts)
- **Networking Tools**: Wireshark, tcpdump (for traffic analysis)
- **Cloud Platforms**: AWS, DigitalOcean (for hosting VPN servers)
